He had been one of the most impactful players in the Super Smash and renowned for having hit the most sixes in Super Smash prior to his late entry to international cricket.[6] He is often confused by fans and English cricket pundits as his namesake Daryl Mitchell is also a right-handed batting all-rounder originally from England who has predominantly played for Worcestershire at county level.</b>
