<h1>Nishanth Sindhu</h1>
<p>
<b>Son of a state-level boxer, Nishant Sindhu too wanted to follow in his father's footsteps but fell in love with cricket after joining the academy run by former Haryana first-class cricketer Ashwani Kumar.

Sindhu shot to recognition after scoring 572 runs and bagging 23 wickets in the U-16 Vijay Merchant Trophy in 2018-19, leading Haryana to victory over Jharkhand in the final.

In the 2022 Under-19 World Cup in West Indies, Sindhu took 6 wickets from 5 games and was one of the top starts for his side. Ahead of the 2023 IPL season, Sindhu was roped in by CSK for INR 60 Lakh.</b>
